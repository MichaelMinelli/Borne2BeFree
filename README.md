Alma Self-Check Application

## Under Development

This project is under development. It's meant to be a quick project to see if we can take the existing js client and use it with a node.js api proxy server. This should avoid the need to have a CORS exception and having the API key in the client's web browser.

## Install

To install it, set the constants in the `main.js` and `js/self-check.js` files and run `npm install` in the project root on a server that has node and npm installed.
